        When you create a Whisper Page, we implement the following security
        measures to ensure your privacy and protect your data:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc mt-4">
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Storage:</strong> Each Whisper Page's content is encrypted
          with a unique key using ChaCha20Poly1305 and then stored in a SQLite
          database. This database is encrypted at rest using Linux LUKS block
          storage encryption secrets. The unique key and link are then encrypted
          by a master key using ChaCha20Poly1305. The encrypted unique key and
          link are stored with the encrypted content while the master key is
          stored separately.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Secure transmission:</strong> Your communication to Whisper
          Pages is encrypted in transit using QUIC (HTTP/3).
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Self-Destruction:</strong> Whisper Pages are deleted after a
          period set by the user. Users also have the option to automatically
          delete a Whisper Page once it has been viewed.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>SHA-256 Hash Links:</strong> When a Whisper Page is created,
          two SHA-256 hashes are generated to serve as the path for the Whisper
          Page. This makes it incredibly difficult for someone to try to
          enumerate through potential paths.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>No-Log Policy:</strong> We do not store logs of your
          communications. Once a whisper expires, it is permanently deleted from
          the database.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>User Anonymity:</strong> Whisper.Page doesn't require any
          personal information to use our service. However, we do collect page
          view data on pages that are not Whisper Pages using Counter.dev to
          understand how our service is being used.
        </li>
      </ul>
